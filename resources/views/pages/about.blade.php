        <b>Welcome to my Mini project III</b>
        <br>
        <br>All you need to know is that we are all about learning everything about laravel!</p>

        <div>

            In this mini project we setup the database models, migrations, unit tests, and seeds for the FAQ project's users, profile,

            </br>questions, and answers.  You must make a new branch for each feature and commit each feature to that branch as it's completed.  <br>

            Each branch (Profile, Question, Answer) should have the model, migration, factory, test, and seed files for it.

            You need to submit a github repo, a screenshot(s) of your tests, and a link to the project working on heroku. <br>

        </div>

        <div>
            <br>
            We also setup views to display the seed data for the user profile, user home page to display questions, the question page that displays the answers to

            question in the sidebar.

            When you display questions, you should show the number of answers and the time since the question was updated.

            Submit a Link to your GitHub and Heroku.   You should have a series of commits and follow the process for branching used in the video.

            You should have a branch for the homepage, profile, question, and answer.
