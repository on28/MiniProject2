# MiniProject3
FAQ project to build a question and answer forum using laravel.
In this mini project we setup the database models, migrations, unit tests, and seeds for the FAQ project's users, profile,
questions, and answers. You must make a new branch for each feature and commit each feature to that branch as it's completed.
Each branch (Profile, Question, Answer) should have the model, migration, factory, test, and seed files for it. You need to submit a github repo, a screenshot(s) of your tests, and a link to the project working on heroku.
